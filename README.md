An implementation of an entire open-source technology stack for a public library system

fosspl (Free and Open Source Software Public Library) is an implementation of an entire open-source technology stack for a public library system. It is based off of the requirements of the [Charleston County Public Library](https://ccpl.org), a library system with (as of 2024) 18 branches, as well as 1 support services building for administrative staff.

The goal of fosspl is not _necessarily_ to be used in totality one day by a library system (although that would be cool), it's more of a proof of concept as well as a disaster-recovery template. It's unlikely that patrons and staff of any particular library system will feel comfortable moving completely away from the current standard operating systems, which, undeniably, are Microsoft Windows and MacOS.

fosspl assumes a service profile similar to that of the Charleston County Public Library, while trying to be as hardware-agnostic as possible. Most of the development will occur on virtual machines, but these same virtual machines can be implemented as physical devices without much fuss.

There's more about the philosophy and the implementation itself in the documentation.
